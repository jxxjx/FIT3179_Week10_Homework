<p id="caption-bar-chart">The sharp decline in foreign arrivals in 2020 and 2021 is a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 18, 2020, Malaysia implemented a nationwide Movement Control Order (MCO) that effectively closed its international borders to tourists. These national measures, combined with the global shutdown of air travel, kept arrival numbers at historic lows until the gradual reopening of borders began in 2022.</p>
